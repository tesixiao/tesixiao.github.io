Currently, I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.ucdavis.edu/), [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), advised by [Prof. Krishna Balasubramanian](https://sites.google.com/view/kriznakumar/). I received my B.S. degree in Statistics from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) (thesis advisor: Prof. Peng Zhang). My research interests lie at the interface of computational and algorithmic inferential problems arising in statistical machine learning. Precisely, I am working on the following topics:

- Reinforcement Learning: Non-asymptotic analysis for off-policy value-based methods for single/multi-agent RL.

- Stochastic Optimization: Computational complexities and statistical inferential problems for first/zeroth-order algorithms.

I am also interested in theory and computation for tensors, unsupervised learning in general.

## Recent News

- 03/28/2021: I will join the AML team at Bytedance Inc. as a research intern this summer.
- 05/15/2020: I passed the Ph.D. qualifying exam and was advanced to candidancy.
